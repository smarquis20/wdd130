            <p>
                Missouri holds significant historical importance for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                as it was designated by Joseph Smith as the site for Zion, a central gathering place for believers. In the 1830s, 
                LDS followers settled in Jackson County, Missouri, with the intention of establishing Zion, but they faced 
                persecution and were eventually expelled from the area.
