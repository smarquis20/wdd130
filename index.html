                My name is Shaun Merrill Marquis.  I am a father of four children and have been married for 18 years.  I enjoy working in computers and currently work for Oracle as a Database Administrator.  I manage several hundred servers for hospitals, making sure that they are always up and running. I am currently working towards my software development degree.  I hope to be able to use this new degree to move into the software side of things.  Our family has lived in Kansas City Missouri for about 10 years now and love it. In my off time I enjoy spending time with my children and playing PC games.

            <p>
                Missouri holds significant historical importance for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                as it was designated by Joseph Smith as the site for Zion, a central gathering place for believers. In the 1830s, 
                LDS followers settled in Jackson County, Missouri, with the intention of establishing Zion, but they faced 
                persecution and were eventually expelled from the area.
